    <h1>Stereotype Threat Research</h1>
    <h2>Or why I'm completely unqualified to speak on this topic.</h2>
    <h4>May 17, 2015</h4>

    <section>
      <p>For this week we were asked to research stereotype threat - presumably to better prepare ourselves to look out for and counter its causes and effects. Given that stereotype threat involves group members artificially limiting their own performance to comply with negative stereotypes society or individuals impose upon them, this is a noble goal. However, after conducting even minimal reading of the resources proposed to us, I can already tell this is an impractical goal for a computer science program</p>
      <p>Following the provided link to <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">the definition of sterotype threat</a>, I was immediately drawn to <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_good_aronson_harder.html">the only referenced study</a> on methods of combating this problem, and almost immediately realized that I do not possess the qualifications to assess this issue.</p>
      <p><small>"Test performance was higher for women than men in the stereotype threat negation condition but was equivalent in the stereotype threat condition. Assessment of course grades showed that female and male students did not differ significantly in the grades they received at the end of the semester, but practice test scores overpredicted final grades for women on the stereotype threat negation condition."</small></p>
      <p>In other words, something was unfair, but we can't know what. If the course grades were fair, the men and women were equally capable. But then they should have scored equally on the GRE-like test. And they did. So does this mean that the GRE is already designed to counter gender stereotype threat? How? If not, then the women should have scored higher. But doesn't this mean the course grades weren't correct after all?</p>
      <p>Without training in psychology and psychological research, I am not qualified to parse these issues. The one point I did find significant, however, was that simply telling everyone that the test would be fair seemed to (mostly) negate any stereotype threat that may have been present.</p>
      <p>So if that's true, why are we being asked to research stereotype threat &dash; which seems highly likely to compound the potential effects thereof with added anxiety &dash; instead of being told that DBC's curriculum is designed to be fair to everyone?</p>
