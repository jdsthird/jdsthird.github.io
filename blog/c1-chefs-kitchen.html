        I am overwhelmingly excited to dive into the DBC curriculum, get to know my cohort, and begin building some truly great things. I love immersive learning. It is my favorite teaching method. Though incredibly difficult and demanding on teachers, I find that immersive learning promotes deep understanding because it forces the student to understand a subject well enough to essentially teach themself.

        I am less enthusiastic about the personal growth portions of the curriculum insofar as they are difficult to teach remotely. When it comes to coding, one can simply assign various tasks to complete. Students of greater skill will complete the tasks faster until they reach an appropriate difficulty level. On the other hand, it is very hard for anyone to learn empathy through reading or watching videos. One has to interact with people, and share experiences.
