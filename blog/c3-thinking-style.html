    <h1>The Shortfalls of Sequential Analysis</h1>
    <h2>Or why I hate CSS</h2>
    <h4>April 25, 2015</h4>

    <section>
      <p>My Gregorc thinking style is sequential analysis, which I have generally found very helpful when learning to program. Computers are entirely logical entities, and the internet is full of useful computer science information, so this is a subject well-suited to the isolated, calculated learning that I prefer.</p>
      <p>Pair programming pushes me out of my comfort zone a bit, but I try to maintain a growth perspective on it. I know that I can learn a lot from other people, even if we are both beginners. I also know that with some practice, I can get better at working in pairs. The biggest problem I have is that I want to organize the interaction, which difficult to do the first time you interact with someone. This difficulty will partly resolve itself as I grow more confident in my own abilities, but I can also speed the process by being honest with myself and my pairing partners about the facts that I won't know everything and we won't necessary get a "perfect" result, but that's ok. Also by reminding myself to just chill and go with it. </p>
      <p>When does the yoga start, again?</p>
      <p>Seriously though, the largest challenge has been CSS. I find CSS much more frustrating because it's hard to identify the "flow" of the language. One must understand both HTML and CSS to have any prayer of success, and CSS requires almost no structure. One can write entries in any order with no ill effects, so it's hard to proceed sequentially through problems.</p>
      <p>I have been attempting to work through my hangups by inspecting website I know in my browser, and getting a feel for how they are organized. Then I can try to follow that organization to recreate a site I am familiar with. Hopefully, with enough practice, I will be able to grasp the "big picture" well enough to feel comfortable with the inherent flexibility of CSS.</p>
