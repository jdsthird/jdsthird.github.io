    <section>
      <p>I want to start this post by pointing out that I am the farthest thing from a minority that exists in America. I do not pretend to understand what it is like to encounter a glass ceiling or to be racially profiled. Consequently, I would not presume to fully understand this problem or have any type of a solution. But I have noticed a lot of debate regarding the cause of the measurable bias in the tech industry without a lot of answers. So really all I'm left with are my own observations, and a lot of questions.</p>
      <p>I graduated college in 2008 with a degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago, and I noticed something rather striking when I looked through the graduation statistics. UofC is divided into five collegiate divisions: Biology, Humanities, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, and the New Collegiate Division. I was struck by the fact that only 25% of the physical sciences graduates (which included Computer Science majors) were women. In aggregate, the class was almost perfectly divided male/female, and the other four collegiate divisions gender statistics were almost perfectly consistent.</p>
      <p>Though I can't say the statistic surprized me, I still don't quite understand it. This was a top-ten college. Every single one of the women in that class was qualified to pursue a physical sciences degree! The vast majority went to schools with a multitude of AP science classes, most took at least one of those classes, and those who didn't have these opportunities were clearly very brilliant people who had outperformed the expectations of their school.</p>
      <p>So, we have a collection of brilliant women who aren't becoming mathematicians, physists, chemists, or computer scientists, and the question is why. I see four possibilities:</p>
      <p><ol>
        <li>Academics provide resistance,</li>
        <li>Peers provide resistance,</li>
        <li>Employers provide resistance, and</li>
        <li>Women are actually less interested.</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the tech industry itself can't do a whole lot about three of these four possibilities. Short of founding or funding schools, employers can only hire those women who do apply. They can't make women pursue careers in tech. So the biggest problem with this tech industry problem is that it's unlikely just a tech industry problem. It's also an academic and societal problem. Therefore, while we should be encouraging and applauding efforts by tech firms to hire more women, we can't stop there. We have to ask ourselves what we as a society are doing to discourage women from pursuing tech and scientific careers.</p>
      <p>So, as I said in the beginning, I don't have any answers for anyone. I am not qualified to provide any. But I do have some questions for anyone reading this post: Did I miss any possible causes? Have you seen instances of women being unfairly discouraged from studying tech? If you are a woman, have you ever felt discouraged from studying science or technology? And if so, how?</p>
      <p>I look forward to hearing from anyone willing to provide their thoughts. As I have not yet implemented the ability to comment on this page, shoot me an email.</p>
