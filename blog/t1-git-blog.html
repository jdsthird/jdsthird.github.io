		<h1>Version Control, Git, and Github</h1>
		<h4>April 13, 2015</h4>

			Our studies this week have focused on using Git and Github to implement version control on our projects. Version control is a technique by which small changes to program or project are saved separately as versions or "commits" of the final. This technique allows developers (or any creator, really) both to keep track of when changes were made, and to roll back those changes if necessary. Additionally, frequent versioning prevents data loss in the event of a system malfunction during editing.

			Git is a local program run on a user's machine to facilitate versioning. Git tracks specified folders, and the changes made to documents contained therein. The user chooses exactly which changes should be committed to new versions, and can revert to previous change states if he or she chooses.
			</p>

			Github is an online repository for open source programs. It works in conjunction with Git to duplicate the file structure normally stored on a user's machine in the cloud. By storing data online in this way, Github allows developers around the globe to work on software simultaneously without overwriting each others' work. Moreover, Github allows developers to actively solicit review of proposed changes by his or her colleagues to better ensure smooth updates.
