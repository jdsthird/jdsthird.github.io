    <h1>Reflections on Pairing</h1>
    <h2>Or, The Feedback Loop</h2>
    <h4>May 6, 2015</h4>

    <section>
      <p>I very much appreciate feedback, but hate pairing online. I appreciate that in some situations it is necessary, and I have learned much from people I've paired with. But so much of the confusion and frustration that occurs is a function of being in different locations. Nearly all of the negative feedback I've received has been related to communicating over Google Hangouts: false starts, lack of clarity due to inability to point or write effectively. Many specific issues can be resolved, &dash; e.g. by remembering to highlight text onscreen or by typing simple examples or outlines &dash; but it is frustrating to know that many others will resolve themselves in a few weeks when we are onsite.</p>
      <p>That said, I'm glad to receive feedback on my work; I know I have a lot to learn. And everyone has done a good job of providing kind, specific, constructive criticism when they have it. For example, many people described interactions that were difficult, and pointed out what both parties could have done to improve the interaction. In my mind, this removes nearly all potential for hurt feelings by reminding that the critic is also falliable.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, I am glad to receive feedback on my work, and look forward to getting into some truly complex coding to truly test my abilities.</p>
