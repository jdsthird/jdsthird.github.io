    <h2>Or, Why Cycle Takes an Optional Argument</h2>
    <h4>May 2, 2015</h4>

    <section>
      <p>There are numerous ways to create loops in Ruby, and we have explicitly covered two already: the while loop and the each loop. A cycle loop combines the former's open endedness and the latter's ability to draw inputs from an enumerable. In fact, we will see later that a cycle loop can be used in place of either a while or an each loop.</p>
      <p>But first, how does a cycle loop work? The syntax is much like an each loop, but the code executed in each step is contained within braces instead of a do...end block. The format is: enumerable.cycle(#){|i| f(i)} where # is the desired number of loops and f(i) is some function to be performed repeatedly. Importantly, the number of cycles is an optional argument. This means that cycle can be used to replicate a while loop, for example:</p>
      <p> count = 0 <br> [37].cycle{|i| count < 1000000 ? count += i : break}.</p>
      <p>This loop will continue until count is greater than or equal to one million, and the developer does not need to know when that will happen.</p>
      <p>That cycle can be used in place of each should be obvious. Simply set # = 1 to cycle exactly once through the enumerable:</p>
      <p>enumerable(1){|i| f(i)}</p>
      <p>So when is a cycle loop more useful than while or each? When you need to iterate many times, of course! Now, I suspect that cycle will become most useful once we learn to create dynamic code in ruby, but here is a simpler example: suppose we are designing a video game, and want the enemies to move in a random pattern. We could randomly generate a series of movements and store those values in an array. We can then call cycle on the array to make the enemy follow that series of movements indefinitely.</p>
