    <section>
      <p>In order to demonstrate the broad utility of classes, I chose to make a class out of the first thing that popped into my head: A Laundry Machine! Speculation as to why I have nothing better to do midday on a Tuesday than laundry aside, laundry machines actually make pretty good object examples. Let's consider their properties:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>Three-dimensional size,</li>
        <li>They run on electricity (they have to be plugged in),</li>
        <li>They can hold clothes,</li>
        <li>They have a maximum capacity,</li>
        <li>They require detergent (which has to be loaded), and</li>
        <li>They wash clothes.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>So how do we translate these attributes into a class? The first can easily be approximated with length, width, and height attributes. Whether the machine is plugged in makes a great boolean variable, as does the loading of detergent. Clothes is a little more complicated because there are many types of clothes, and we can't know in advance what type they will be or how many will be loaded into the machine. We only know the machine's capacity, which you probably guessed is easiest stored as an integer.</p>
      <p>So here we have a perfect example of the benefits of classes. We don't need to worry about what type of clothes may be stuffed into our washing machine because those clothes themselves can be class objects, which will report to us their own attributes. By including size (an integer) and clean (a boolean) as attributes of the clothing class(es) and passing them to the washing machine, the machine can determine when it is full. The wash cycle can then be a function that sets all the clean variables to true. Below is my implementation of the washing machine class and some supporting clothing classes:</p>
      <pre>
      <code>
      class Shirt <br>
        attr_reader :size <br>
        attr_accessor :clean <br>
   <br>
        def initialize <br>
          @size = 5 <br>
          @clean = false <br>
        end <br>
      end <br>
 <br>
      class Pants <br>
        attr_reader :size <br>
        attr_accessor :clean <br>
        def initialize <br>
          @size = 4 <br>
          @clean = false <br>
        end <br>
      end <br>
 <br>
      class Socks <br>
        attr_reader :size <br>
        attr_accessor :clean <br>
        def initialize <br>
          @size = 1 <br>
          @clean = false <br>
        end <br>
      end <br>
 <br>
      class Washing_Machine <br>
        def initialize(length, width, height, capacity) <br>
          @length = length <br>
          @width = width <br>
          @height = height <br>
          @capacity = capacity <br>
          @plugged_in = true <br>
          @detergent_loaded = false <br>
          @contents = [] <br>
        end <br>
 <br>
        attr_reader :length, :width, :height <br>
        attr_accessor :plugged_in, :detergent_loaded <br>
 <br>
        def state <br>
          @contents.inject(0){|sum, n| sum + n.size} <br>
        end <br>
 <br>
        def remaining_capacity <br>
          @capacity - self.state <br>
        end <br>
 <br>
        #input clothes must be an array of clothing objects <br>
        def load(clothes) <br>
          @contents += clothes <br>
        end <br>
        def cycle <br>
          if @contents.empty? <br>
            p "There are no clothes in the machine to wash." <br>
          else <br>
            @contents.each {|i| i.clean = true} <br>
          end <br>
        end <br>
 <br>
        def empty <br>
          output = @contents.dup <br>
          @contents.clear <br>
          output <br>
        end <br>
      end
      </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Now, I hope your first response to the above code is why? And although the simple answer is, "John was doing laundry while working on this problem," the example does illustrate the basic purpose and design of classes. Also, maybe I'm working on the next Sims Game. So there!</p>
