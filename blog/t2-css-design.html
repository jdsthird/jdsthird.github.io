    <h1>Margins, Borders, and Padding:</h1>
    <h2>The CSS Sandwich</h2>
    <h4>April 19, 2015</h4>

      <p>It may surprise a budding web developer to learn that CSS offers three different methods of adding space around an individual section of html &dash; I certainly know I was! At first glance, margins, borders, and paddings may seem redundant, but they actually accomplish distinct and important tasks.</p>

      <p>It should not be hard to understand why a developer might want to put space around content. Anyone who has used a word processor understands the concept of margins. Without them, words would run right up to the edge of the page, which looks terrible and renders documents all but impossible to print. So the need for surrounding space is clear, but why three different properties?</p>

      <p>The answer is deceptively simple: <em>to position the border!</em> When one draws a border around content, &dash; let's consider text again for simplicity &dash; that boarder has several properties users are accustomed to adjusting. For example, width, color, and dashed versus solid. But how far from the text should the boarder be drawn? If located too close to the text, the document will be difficult to read. On the other hand, too much space leaves the reader wondering what the border does at all.</p>

      <p>Padding takes care of this problem by allowing the developer to fine tune the spacing between the content and the boarder. Similarly, margins adjust the space between the boarder and neighboring sections. When used together effectively, the developer has precise control over the positioning of various sections and the content within.</p>
