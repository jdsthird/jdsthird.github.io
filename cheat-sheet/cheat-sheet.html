                  <p>Ruby syntax is extremely simple. The programmer need type little more than absolutely necessary.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No declaration of any kind is necessary to declare variables. One simply initializes it: <pre>variable = 27</pre></li>
                    <li>Methods are not treated as variables (unless they are lambdas). They are given their own syntax:
                    <pre>
def function(input)
  input * 2
end
                    </pre></li>

               <div class="bucket-body">
                <p>JavaScript's syntax is like a simplified version of Java. Which is to say, not very simple.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Variables must be declared as variables, but no type need be specified:<pre>var variable = 27;
                    </pre></li>
                    <li>Most lines must end with a semicolon. JavaScript is not as strict about this requirement as Java, but it makes life easier to just assume they are needed in the same places.</li>
                    <li>Functions can be treated as variables or not, depending on the preference of the programmer.
                      <ul>
                        <li>If not treated as a variable, the function will be compiled prior to runtime. This means that the function can be declared anywhere in the code.<pre>
function name(input{
  input * 2;
}
                      </pre></li>
                      <li>If a function is treated as a variable, it must be declared in code before it can be used.<pre>
var name = function(input){
  input * 2;
}
                      </pre></li>
                      </ul></li>
                    <li>There is no such thing as a hash in JavaScript because an object is a hash.</li>
                    <li>Array are defined as a special class of object.</li>

                  <p>In ruby, everything is an object, so creating new ones is nothing special. However, one can customize the process by creating classes of objects that contain certain properties and functions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classes are created entirely inside the class designator.</li>
                    <li>A class must contain an explicit initialization function or constructor.</li>
                    <li>Instance variables are identified with a preceding &amp; symbol.</li>

               <div class="bucket-body">
                  <p>In JavaScript, one does not define a class, but create a constructor function, and then modify the prototype object used by that function to create instance objects.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Classes are defined by writing constructors, which are functions.</li>
                    <li>No initialization function need be defined because the class definition is itself the constructor function.</li>
                    <li>The constructor does not define methods for that class. These must be added afterwards.</li>
                    <li>In JavaScript, all objects have a 'prototype', which is like a blueprint object. Class methods are created by modifying the class prototype.</li>
                    <li>Instance variables are identified with the 'this' prefix, which is similar to 'self' in ruby.</li>
